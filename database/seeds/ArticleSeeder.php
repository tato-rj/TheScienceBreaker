            "content" => "<p>For humans, the ocean is vast and mysterious. The portrayal of top predators in the ocean – from krakens to Moby Dick – shows how they have historically been feared and hunted. For the true top predators – oceanic sharks and rays – mortality has increased steeply, as technology allowed humans to fish further from shore, with deadlier gear, for longer periods of time. The sustainability of these fisheries has suffered from inaction due to gaps in our knowledge about sharks and rays. In particular, we have had little consensus about the historic range, size and status of their populations and species, hindering the policy actions that are necessary to protect them from extinction. In a new study, we provide scientific evidence that overfishing has endangered oceanic sharks and rays in modern times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our team started to fill the knowledge gap by assembling data on trends in shark and ray abundance from government reports, industry, and academic sources from around the world. For 18 of the oceanic species, we modelled their changes in abundance since 1970. For these species and another 13 species without complete data on population abundance over time, we combined available data and expert knowledge. This allowed us to infer their historic and current status on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List (a standardized index of the global extinction risk of a species).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our study shows that open ocean ecosystems have been fundamentally altered by the replacement of top predators with fishing fleets. The sobering conclusion is that shark and ray populations have been devastated by relentless fishing pressure, and that this tragedy has played out repeatedly in different oceans across the globe. For much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, most sharks were caught unintentionally by fishing gears targeting tunas. In recent decades, however, sharks and rays have become increasingly valuable for their meat or products marketed for celebratory dishes or medicinal properties in Asia. For some species, we found that regional differences in population status can be explained by differences in the political will of nations to protect and rebuild shark populations. For example, the three endangered hammerhead shark species have increased in the Northwest Atlantic, despite their dire status elsewhere, partially because of protection in U.S. waters. Yet this positive example is an exception, not the rule. In the same ocean, the Shortfin Mako shark has been driven to dangerously low numbers. Two nations primarily responsible for fishing the Shortfin Mako (Spain and Portugal) agreed to stop only in early 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We concluded that oceanic sharks and rays are now threatened with extinction, despite the fact they have lived in the ocean longer than almost all other vertebrates. Until our study, we did not have quantitative evidence for the severity of their declines. This gap in our knowledge has impeded the implementation of limits on their catch. The high seas (open ocean areas that do not belong to any nation) still resemble a frontier society, where the laws of nations do not hold and measure safeguarding wildlife and human rights are scant. There are still no treaties to guide the sustainable and fair stewardship of resources extracted from the open ocean. Instead, there are a few international entities that represent the interests of nations and businesses for which the high seas hold economic or cultural value. The most prominent of these entities are the five <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/oceans-and-fisheries/fisheries/international-agreements/regional-fisheries-management-organisations-rfmos_en\">Regional Management Fishery Organizations</a>, which are charged with managing oceanic tuna fisheries. Overfishing of sharks by tuna fleets has been suspected for decades, but actions to conserve them have been few. Even now, we don't know how intensely they are fished in some regions. In the northern Indian Ocean, where shark abundance has declined steeply in recent years, vast numbers of small boats use gillnets to catch sharks and tuna, but most of this catch is unreported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been slow to recognize the true extent of human impacts on open ocean ecosystems, including overfishing, changes in water chemistry and temperature, and the prevalence of plastic pollution. These threats are diffuse, and countering their impacts will require overhauling the political and economic <em>status quo.</em> However, high seas fisheries are unique in that their activities can be directly linked to specific boats. This fact offers tremendous potential to implement solutions in our toolkit that we already know can be effective. Fishing can be sustainable if we invest in scientific monitoring and assessment of fish populations and produce scientific quotas and prohibitions on the catch of sharks and rays. Enforcing such measures would require bycatch reporting, observers on every boat, and traceability in seafood supply chains. The fate of oceanic fishes is not sealed, and with these tools, a brighter future is possible.</p>",

            "content" => "<p>Have you noticed a surge in heatwaves in the last decade? Heatwaves are becoming more common and so are their negative effects. So how do we alleviate these negative impacts? Most answers to this question involve using water directly or indirectly. European cities, for example, adopt a variety of water-dependent strategies such as greening streets and roofs to adapt to a warming climate. But what if there is not enough water to support those strategies? What if droughts and heatwaves happen at the same time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, climate extremes like heatwaves and droughts are analyzed in isolation, and adaptation measures are adopted to address each phenomenon separately. However, when multiple extremes happen simultaneously or successively, they can cause larger ecological and societal damages than the sum of damages that each individual extreme would induce. Many extreme events have a complex chain of interdependencies that make their co-occurrence and succession more likely. It is, therefore, imperative to analyze codependent climate extremes together to avoid underestimating their risks.</p>\r\n\r\n</p>We analyzed the frequency of dry, hot, and dry-AND-hot extremes across the contiguous U.S. between 1896 and 2017. We used a myriad of statistical tests to determine changes in the precipitation and temperature trends, and how they change together. Further, we used a spatial correlation analysis method to determine if single climatic extremes are enlarging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our results show that while the frequency of dry years have not changed during the 122 years of this study over the contiguous U.S., the frequency of hot years has increased. More importantly, we show that Western U.S. has observed a larger frequency of dry-AND-hot years in the recent decades. For example, 25-year dry-AND-hot extremes – which are expected to happen only once every 25 years – have occurred eight to ten times in the past quarter-century in some regions. Even more worrisome, more intense extremes that are expected only once every 75 years occurred four or five times in the past 25 years. Not only such compound events occurred more frequently, but also dry-AND-hot extremes have notably intensified in the recent decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intensification of dry-AND-hot extremes is partly due to land-atmosphere feedbacks. Dry soils partition a large portion of the incoming solar radiation to sensible heat (what we sense as hot air), and a small portion as latent heat (evaporation). This causes the local air temperature to increase, which in turn enhances local evaporation, causing more drying. This cycle, known as self-intensification, continues until a large-scale weather patterns breaks it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also show that the initiating mechanism of this cycle in the US has changed from the lack of precipitation in the 1930s to excess heat in recent decades. This is important because now if we have a year with even slightly below normal precipitation, we might experience a moderate to severe drought due to the increasing evaporation in a warming climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, we showed that dry-AND-hot extremes impact an increasingly larger spatial area across the contiguous U.S. Spatial correlation analysis shows that dry-AND-hot extremes have expanded in a homogenous, connected pattern, providing evidence for a process known as self-propagation – i.e. dry-AND-hot air move from one region to neighboring downwind areas causing self-intensification of dryness and heat in the new location.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dry-AND-hot events are the recipe for large wildfires, add wind and a source of ignition, and they secure megafires. The 2020 fires across the western U.S. are examples of how dry-AND-hot extremes can cause major societal and ecological disasters. Drought alongside the hot summer of 2020 and several record-breaking heatwaves collectively dried out the forests in the region. Several storms brought thousands of lightning strikes and wind to fuel many megafires in California, Oregon and Colorado. Other western states were lucky to dodge the bullet this year!<p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, frequency, intensity and impact area of concurrent dry-AND-hot events increased in the contiguous U.S. and across the world in the past century. A warming climate promotes concurrence of multiple extremes, which turn natural hazards into disasters and squander emergency management and relief resources. The future will bring us more of these disasters, if the current warming trends continue; are we ready? Are we adapting to a warming climate fast enough? Are we taking action to slow climate change?</p>",
