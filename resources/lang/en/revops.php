In particular, your text is checked for: (i) plagiarism, (ii) English language level, (iii) use of jargon, and (iv) length. If the text does not meet the minimal requirements, the editor-in-chief contacts you as soon as possible to explain the decision. Where possible, the editor-in-chief recommends where/how to improve your manuscript for an eventual re-submission.',

    'p1' => 'Manuscripts accepted for further revision are handed in to the managing editor, a senior scientist with a breadth of expertise on the subject of your submission. The managing editor reads your submission, reads the original article described in the submission, and discusses the manuscript again with the editor-in-chief. The managing editor takes in the inputs received and assigns the manuscript to a review operations editor, thereby initiating the process of “<b><i>lay-peer-editing</b></i>”.',
    'p2' => 'The process of “<b><i>lay-peer-editing</b></i>” is a distinguished feature of TheScienceBreaker. Review operations editors, internal members of TheScienceBreaker’s team, are young scientists from the International PhD Program in Life Sciences of the University of Geneva. This policy has the specific aim of allowing PhD students to perform, side-by-side to their school/research obligations, a science communication training, and first-hand editorial experience. Science communication specialists closely follow up review operations editors so that they may deliver a high-quality lay-editing of your material.',
    'p3' => 'Before starting the revision, the review operations editor will contact you, introducing him/herself and confirming the “take in charge” of your submission. Once the revision is completed, it is sent back to the managing editor who discusses the editing with the review operations editor. The review operations editor takes in any eventual input, and finally sends back the revision to you with any recommendation and suggested editing. This first revision is handed back to you in an average time-frame of 30 days from the assignment to the managing editor. Your review operations editor will then assist you in the process of refining your manuscript until you will agree to a final draft of your manuscript.',

If necessary, any additional input is suggested to the review operations editor, otherwise, the manuscript is set on the pipeline for the publication online.',
    'p2' => 'In order to facilitate the engagement with your piece by our readership, your review operations editor will draft a short description (one-two sentences) of the manuscript. This short description is sent to you together with the final decision. Ahead of publication online you may suggest any eventual correction.',
